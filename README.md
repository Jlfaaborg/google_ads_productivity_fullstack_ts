# Intro

Hello and welcome. **Google Ads Productivity** is an app designed to add phonecall conversions and website conversions to a Google Ads account. 

## The Problem

While [GoogleAdsEditor](https://ads.google.com/home/tools/ads-editor/) offers most of the functionality you would want to perform on a daily basis, it does not offer support for uploading conversions in bulk.

## The Solution

My app is designed to allow a user to upload a CSV, edit the uploaded data, and Submit the data to be passed to Google.
Technologies:
 -  **React** front-end written with **Typescript**
 - **Express** back-end to call **Google's Api** using the **Oauth2** workflow
 - **Redux** state management (with  **Hooks**)
